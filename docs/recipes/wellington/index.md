## Instruction

1. Combine the ground flax and 5 tablespoons of water in a small bowl. Set aside for 10 min.
2. Sauté the onion, carrots, and celery in a large skillet over medium heat until softened, about 6-8 minutes.
3. Add the garlic, thyme, sage, and rosemary. Sauté for 1 minute.
4. Add the mushrooms and sauté until they soften and release their moisture, about 5-7 minutes. You want the pan to be dry. Add the tamari and cook for 1 minute. Remove from heat and set aside to cool for 10 minutes.
5. Add the chickpeas to a large mixing bowl and mash with a potato masher. Leave a bi of texture.
6. Add the cooled mixture, breadcrumbs, walnut meal, flax mixture, Worcestershire, tomato paste, salt, and pepper. Combine well with a spatula and use your hands if needed. Taste and add more seasoning if preferred. If the mixture seems too wet, you can add another more breadcrumbs or rolled oats.
7. Shape the mixture into a solid log that will fit in the middle of the pastry sheet.
8. Seal the loaf in the pastry sheet. Remove any excess dough. Use non-dairy milk to seal if needed.
9. Brush the top and sides with melted vegan butter.
10. Make diagonal slits across the whole top of the loaf about 1-inch apart. Repeat going the other direction.
11. Place in the oven for 30-35 minutes (200°C) until heated throughout and the pastry is golden brown. Let sit 10 minutes before serving.
